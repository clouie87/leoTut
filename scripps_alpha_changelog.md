###### Changes
 

- we’re going to tell the tagManager the server_name and tag that was just created (new_tag) 

- given the server_name and new_tag the tagManager will find the merged pull requests between the last tag with the server_name and new_tag 

- it will parse and create the change log from merged pull requests text 

- then updates the release notes on github with the changes that have been made, and the verification data (which allows us to find the server_name in the future) 

- Release Note Example: <img width="856" alt="screen shot 2016-11-08 at 10 56 57 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8782239/20129725/b9a85554-a606-11e6-92f6-a280e6d52ddb.png">
