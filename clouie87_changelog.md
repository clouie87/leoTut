###### Changes
 
- weâ€™re going to tell the tagManager the server_name and tag that was just created (new_tag) 
- given the server_name and new_tag the tagManager will find the merged pull requests between the last tag with the server_name and new_tag 
- it will parse and create the change log from merged pull requests text 
- then updates the release notes on github with the changes that have been made, and the verification data (which allows us to find the server_name in the future)
